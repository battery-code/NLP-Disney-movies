Sentiment analysis and Topic Modeling of Disney movie scripts

Problem Statement:
Analyze Disney movie transcripts and chart the change in sentiment of each movie. Analyse for common topics across the movies (Topic Modeling). 

Case:
Renowned Author Kurt Vonnegut was a Master's student in Anthropology at University of Chicago. His Master's thesis was rejected because the premise seemed too simple and looked fun. But he was onto something. The premise as best said by Vonnegut himself is, "The fundamental idea is that stories have shapes which can be drawn on graph paper, and that the shape of a given societyâ€™s stories is at least as interesting as the shape of its pots or spearheads."

The shape Vonnegut was referring to is the rise and fall of sentiment from start to finish for each story. Now, we have the tools to plot the sentiment of text. 

The work flow :
1) Create the corpus
2) Perform Sentiment analysis
3) Perform Topic Modeling
